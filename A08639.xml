            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>ill beſemeth the ſame: yet I vvas comforted

And this is the propertie of a gentle nature, vvhich al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo cauſed the hauty Perſian king to take in gentle part a cuppe of troubled vvater at one of his ſouldiers handes. Receaue this therefore (my ſingular good Lorde) if not for the tranſlators ſake, vvhich I graunt to be vnvvorthy, yet for the authors ſake O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, vvhoſe excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy I dare compare vvith any ſaue VIRGYL, if not in this vvyſe, yet as the Macedonian kinge Philip dyd heare an vnlearned Orator.

            <head>¶ The Preface to the gentle Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
               </hi> Haue tranſlated (gentle Reader) a lyttle péece of <hi>Ouyd,</hi> which hée wrote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt a fayned friend. It is very hard and therefore deſerueth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more pardon, if in any part therof I haue erred. And that the obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rytie of it ſhould not be diſpleaſant vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thée, (which I know muſt néedes haue bene) I haue added thereunto a brefe draught of all the ſtoryes and tales, that are contayned therein, by reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the reading of it, no doubte, wylbe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pleaſant, &amp; perhaps not without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. For therein ſhal you ſée all maner of vices puniſhed, all offences corrected, &amp; all miſdéedes reuenged. There is nether ſtory, nor tale almoſt, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto hys tyme, wherin any ill luck was noted, to happen to any man, but the Poet wiſheth the ſame to light vpon his aduerſary. The cauſes that moued him to write thus ſharply were two, as in the worke may appeare. One for that after his baniſhment he whiſpered lyes
<pb facs="tcp:14129:5"/>and vntrue tales into <hi>Auguſtus</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peror his eares, therby to kepe him the longer in exile. The other for that he ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited his wife to be vncurteys. Theſe two cauſes if they much incenſed <hi>Ouid,</hi> no man I thinke can blame him. For what greater vncurteſy, I will not ſaye vilany, can be ſhewed to any man, then ſo to treade vpon him when he is down, that he ſhal after neuer be able to riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Of troth me thinketh when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the giftes that God hath beſtowed vpon men, I am almoſt rapt, and beſide my ſelfe, for the greatnes &amp; number of them: but of al frendſhip is the greateſt. Which (if any thinge doe) cometh moſte néere to the celeſtiall ſociety, &amp; heauenly agrement of angels &amp; bleſſed creatures. But it is ſo rare, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſince the beginninge of the world, ther hath ben great ſcarcity therof, ſo that if you conſider y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> number of other men, it will amount to nothing. Surely that man is happy (as ſaith <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly</hi>) who hath one to whom he may fréely breake his minde, and vtter all his cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, who will reioyce wyth hym in proſperitie without enuy, and with true heart be partaker of his aduerſitie, that
<pb facs="tcp:14129:5"/>man may well thinke that he hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the moſt precious iewel in the world But how a man ſhould attaine herevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, but by vertue, which is the ground of fréendſhippe, there is no way, neyther is ther any other meane wherby it is tried and conſerued. That agréement which is amonge euill men, the ſocietie of dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblers, the fellowſhippe of flatterers. the conſente of théeues, is not to be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the name of fréendſhippe, for as much as in theſe is neyther trouth nor plaine dealing, and therefore no fréende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipppe. For except you doe detecte, and open the very ſecreates of your hearte, without coloure to your fréende, and he to you agayne lykewiſe, there can be no conſtant or ſtedfaſt amitie. There muſt be therefore eſpeciall care geuen in the choyſe of a true fréende, leaſte in ſtede of hym we lyghte vppon a flaterer, whych is of ſuch affinitie with hym in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce, that he is verye harde to be deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryed.</p>
            <p>Ther is not ſo hyghe an hill, but a man may clyme to the toppe thereof, not ſo longe a iourney, but it may be gone at length, not ſo déepe a Sea, but it maye
<pb facs="tcp:14129:6"/>be ſounded with Leade, nor ſo ſtronge a Caſtell, but it may be battered wyth ſhotte, not ſo hid a thinge, but it may be reuealed by time, only the heart of man is vnſearchable, ſo that in twenty yeres a man ſhall not finde the depth thereof. Wherefore in myne opynion he was a wyſe man, that wylled vs to eate many buſhels of ſalte, with him who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to make our freende, whereby he meant nothing els, but by longe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, to trye whether he whome we loue, be méete to be our fréende or not. O how many haue thought to haue had true fréendes, but haue ben much decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, wherof you ſhall in the boke folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſée many examples. As of <hi>Theſſalus and Eurialuss, Cocalus and Minos, Mirtilus &amp; Oenomaus,</hi> and ſuch like. There is no poyſon, to the poyſon of a Serpente, no ſtrength, to the ſtrength of Gunpouder, no ſting, to the ſting of the Aſpe, no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyce, to the malyce of a woman, nor no euill, to the euill of a fayned fréende, and a diſſembling louer. It is a great deale better, no doubt, to haue an open enni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie then a counterfeyte friende: For of the one we may take héede, but of the
<pb facs="tcp:14129:6"/>other it is not poſſible to beware. A true frend then muſt nede be ſo much worth, as nothing may be more. For who is not well pleaſed, to heare of <hi>Oreſtes and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lades, Theſeus and Perithous, Achilles and Patroclus, Niſus and Eurialus, Caſtor and Pollux, Damon and Pithias, Achates and Aeneas, Alexander and Epheſtio, Celius and Petronius, C. Lelius and Scipio Affri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus, Darius and Megabiſus,</hi> and a great number of payres of freendes mo, which I could rehearſe, but that it néedeth not? All which ech for other refuſed no death nor torment. Wherfore euen nowe alſo their renown is freſh, &amp; they be extolled aboue the ſkyes, neither ſhal ther be any ſo vngratefull poſterity, which ſhal for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get their paſſing amitie. Contrariwiſe, if we conſider the horrible effects of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie and hatred in <hi>Atreus and Thieſtes, Etheocles and Polinices,</hi> wyth ſuch other, which for breuitie I leaue out, I thinke there will be no man ſo rude, which will not deteſt. But what meane I to entreat of frendſhip, of which ſo many excellent men haue written before in ſuch ſorte: that I ſhall rather hereby bewray the barenneſſe of my ſclender wit, then doe
<pb facs="tcp:14129:7"/>any thing therto worthy prayſe. And the more for that <hi>Fauorinus in Aul. Gellius</hi> ſayth, it is better to diſprayſe earneſtly, then to prayſe coldly. I will therefore leaue to ſpeake of this any more, and wil come to the other cauſe, which no man can wel perceaue, but he that is maried. For my part, if you wil bear with mine vnexperienced iudgemente, I am well pleaſed, that <hi>Ouid</hi> toke it in very euill part to beare <hi>S. Lukes helmet,</hi> ſeeing that many men euen nowe a dayes, be ſcant well content to weare that lothſome li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie. Of this I am well aſſured that <hi>Propertius</hi> coulde be contente that his fréend ſhould be partaker of al the goods he had, and what ſoeuer els was in hys power, but as touching his wife he could ſpare <hi>Iupiter</hi> no parte of hir. He writeth thus.

                  <l>Riualem poſſum non ego ferre Iouem.</l>
               </q> But of theſe cauſes enough. I wil ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore omitte, to blot my paper wyth any more words concerning theſe matters,
<pb facs="tcp:14129:7"/>and will tell you what <hi>Ouid</hi> was, and why he called this worke <hi>Ibis,</hi> and wrote it in ſo hard a ſtile. He was a gentleman of a good houſe, borne at <hi>Sulmo,</hi> who ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to pleaſe hys father, then for any loue he bare thervnto, ſtudyed the lawe. But after his deceaſe, he returned to his olde ſtudy of Poetry againe, wherin he profyted ſo much, that excepte <hi>Virgill,</hi> I dare call him péereleſſe. He was fiftie yeres in proſperitie, &amp; good credyte with <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> but was afterward banyſhed into <hi>Pontus,</hi> where he liued eyght yeres, and then dyed, &amp; was buried in <hi>Dorbite,</hi> a Citie of <hi>Helleſpont.</hi> The cauſe of his baniſhment is vncertayn, but moſt men thinke, &amp; I am of that opinion alſo, that it was for vſing too familiarly <hi>Iulia, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus</hi> his daughter, who of hir ſelfe too much enclined to laſciuiouſnes, was the more incenſed therto by him, vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he wrote many wanton <hi>Elegies,</hi> vnder the name of <hi>Corinna,</hi> as <hi>Sidonius</hi> plainly affirmeth.</p>
